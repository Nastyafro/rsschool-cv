## About
I am a graduate of the Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in civil engineering. In the course of my work, I use various programs for calculating concrete and metal structures, often working with numbers and formulas. Sometimes there are no programs for such calculations, and I thought about writing my own programs. So I decided to try myself in programming, to learn something new for myself.\
I like to solve logical problems and I want to apply this in writing code. I always try to perform the tasks set for myself responsibly, on time and efficiently. I will spend a lot of time and effort for this to succeed. 

I studied German at school, so I am studying English in parallel with RS. Now my English level is A1+, every day I train my level in Duolingo, watch movies in English with subtitles and independently study with a textbook.
